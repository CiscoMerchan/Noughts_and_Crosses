# Noughts & Crosses Game

Welcome to my Noughts & Crosses game! This game was created to help me practice JavaScript and improve my skills in manipulating the DOM.

To develop this game allowed me to practice `function()` and workflow in a way that the app follows a sequence of instructions to make sure that every step is checked before the next step to avoid problems in the continuity of the game.

As well as to practice in vanilla JavaScript how to render dynamic interaction of the page without changing the browser by activating and deactivating CSS codes.

## How to Play

The game is very simple and easy to play. All you have to do is click on any of the `<td>` tags to make your move. Once you make your move, the 'X' image will be rendered on the board, and the computer player will automatically make its move by using the `Math.random()` function, rendering the 'O' image.

The game continues until one player manages to place three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full, resulting in a tie game.
