Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game! This game was created to help me practice JavaScript and improve my skills in manipulating the DOM.

The game is very simple and easy to play. All you have to do is click on any of the <td> tags to make your move. Once you make your move, the 'X' image will be rendered on the board, and the computer player will automatically make its move by using the Math.random() function, rendering the 'O' image.

The game continues until one player manages to place three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full, resulting in a tie game.

I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed creating it. Please feel free to use it to practice your own JavaScript skills or to simply pass the time with a fun game of Tic Tac Toe!
